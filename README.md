- [Steady.js](https://github.com/lafikl/steady.js) : Featured on Hacker news, #1 Most trending open-source project at Github.
- [WPTProxy](https://github.com/lafikl/wptproxy): Will be used by webpagetest.org itself.
- [Fluent](https://github.com/lafikl/fluent)
- [PerfBar](https://github.com/lafikl/perfbar): Will be demo-ed at [Velocity](http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu2014/public/schedule/detail/38145) next monday.

# What is Node.js?
> Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications.

> Node.js provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API that optimizes an application's throughput and scalability. These technologies are commonly used for real-time applications.

> Node.js uses the Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute code, and a large percentage of the basic modules are written in JavaScript. Node.js contains a built-in library to allow applications to act as a Web server without software such as Apache HTTP Server or IIS.


# When you should use it:
- Real-time applications
- Web services
- [Isomorphic applications](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps)
- [Front-end API](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/10/07/node-js-and-the-new-web-front-end/)
- Sharing code between the front-end and back-end
- High concurrency and small cost.
- Speed of development

# Some of Node's major users:
- Groupon
- SAP
- LinkedIn
- Microsoft
- Yahoo
- Walmart
- PayPal
- Box
- Airbnb


# Success Stories:
- [LinkedIn Moved From Rails To Node: 27 Servers Cut And Up To 20x Faster](http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/10/4/linkedin-moved-from-rails-to-node-27-servers-cut-and-up-to-2.html)
- [Eran Hammer was bored last black friday.](https://twitter.com/eranhammer/status/407784258170667009)
